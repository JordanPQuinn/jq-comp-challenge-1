# jq-comp-challenge-1
This challenge involved recreating a pre-designed static web page with the intent of staying as true to the design as possible. Its intent is to test our attention to detail, design, CSS, and HTML skills. The link to the original static design is here: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html.

I was not to take any liberties with the layout and general principles of the design. However, I had creative license to develop a complimentary color palette, source images, and create my own rendition of a responsive design for mobile viewing.
